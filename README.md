# Syrinscape Control

Control and play syrinscape elements within Foundry.

### How to use
Get your authentication token from Syrinscape, and provide this in the module settings.

You are currently required to get a CSV of your sounds from Syrinscape at this link: https://syrinscape.com/account/remote-control-links-csv/
Place the downloaded csv file in the module's `storage/` folder.

Afterwards, the Syrinscape Browser can be accessed from the Playlist directory on the right. From here, you can create playlists or play moods/one-shots individually.

Drag a mood or element to the hotbar to create a macro.
